# Journal

A programmer's journal

## Install

`npm i`

## Run

`npm start`

## Planned Features

* Cloud integration, or at least a configurable directory
* Desktop and mobile
* "Reverse infinite scrolling" because journals can get very long
* Future asides: write notes on past entries
  (you can also just edit old entries, which you can use mainly for spelling corrections or be more liberal with)
* Search
* Hashtags (that you can click on to search)
* Dark mode / themes
* GitHub integration (see commits, pull requests, and maybe other stuff in the timeline)
* Everything's a plugin (EAP)?
* Image presentation (paste an image and if it's bigger than some size it gets thumbnailed and you can click on it to view it bigger; paste multiple images and it becomes a gallery)
